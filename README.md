## Build

Requires `gcc` and `make`. Once the repository is cloned from the remote, you can run these build commands:

**runtime builds:**
```bash
make setup_deps # Clone the dependency repos
make            # Compiles the executable cshell binary
```

**dev builds:**
```bash
make test       # Compiles and runs the test suite (./tests)
make debug      # Builds with debug symbols and sanitisers
```

**clean:**
```bash
make clean_deps # Cleans compiled binaries, .o, .a, and .d files (including compiled dependencies)
make clean      # Cleans compiled binaries, .o, and .d files (just for cshell)
```
